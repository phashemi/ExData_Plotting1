# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

This is my repository for JHU's Coursera's course "Exploratory Data Analysis".  

There are 8 files associated with Project 1 -- four scripts (.R) that resulted in the generation of four separate plots (.png).

They include:

plot1.R

plot1.png

plot2.R

plot2.png

plot3.R

plot3.png

plot4.R

plot4.png



The high-level steps involve:

* Download the data from here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip;

* Extract the data into my subdirectory

* Develop scripts in order to create PNG files that mirror those created by Roger Peng

* Execute the scripts using R version 3.1.3 (note: I received graphics errors using RStudio)

* Submit the files to GitHub
